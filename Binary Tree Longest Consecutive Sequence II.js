/*
 * Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

 * For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid,
 * but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid.
 *
 * On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order,
 * where not necessarily be parent-child order.
